# Advanced Stock Analysis Dashboard

This Streamlit application provides an interactive dashboard for advanced stock analysis, powered by a multi-agent AI system. 

## Inspiration and Credits

This project is heavily inspired by the work of Batuhan Sen (https://medium.com/@batuhansenerr) and his article on "AI-Powered Financial Analysis: Multi-Agent Systems Transform Data into Insights" (https://medium.com/@batuhansenerr/ai-powered-financial-analysis-multi-agent-systems-transform-data-into-insights-d94e4867d75d). The core codebase and agent structure are adapted from his original implementation. 

## How it Works

The application utilizes a team of specialized AI agents, each responsible for a specific aspect of stock analysis:

- **Stock Researcher:** Identifies the stock ticker and gathers basic company information.
- **Financial Analyst:** Performs fundamental and technical analysis, interpreting financial data.
- **News Analyst:** Fetches recent news articles and assesses their potential impact.
- **Report Writer:** Synthesizes all findings into a cohesive and professional stock report.

These agents collaborate to provide comprehensive insights based on user queries.

## Features

- **Natural Language Queries:** Ask questions about stocks in plain English.
- **Fundamental & Technical Analysis:** Get in-depth analysis of financial metrics, trends, and risk assessments.
- **News Sentiment Analysis:** Understand how recent news might influence stock performance.
- **Tailored Reports:** Receive clear and concise reports tailored to your query and level of expertise.

## Getting Started

1. **Enter Your Query:** Type your stock analysis question in the sidebar.
2. **Analyze:** Click the "Analyze" button to initiate the analysis.
3. **View the Report:** The application will generate a detailed stock report based on your query.

## Example Queries

- "Is Apple a safe long-term bet for a risk-averse individual?"
- "What are the growth prospects of Tesla in the next 5 years?"
- "How has the recent oil spill affected BP's stock performance?"
